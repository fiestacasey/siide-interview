Technical Interview For [siide.com](http://www.siide.com/)
==========================================================
 * This is basic project running with Backbone.js front end and a Sinatra backend.

I used:
 * [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/)
 * [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)
 
Requirements:
 * Build a single page web app using Sinatra for the backend. 
 * Backbone.js for the front end. 
 * You can use any database backend you'd like. ActiveRecord, Datamapper, Mongoid, straight MongoDB, straight SQL,  SQLite, anything really. At Siide we use Sequel but its not a requirement. You could even store it in memory.
 * Deploy it to Heroku. 
 * Use a public Github account as your repository, you can use a pseudonym if you'd like.
 * Keep track of any issues that got in your way, and roughly how long it took.
 
Application Requirements:
 * Create a Todo
 * List todos
 * Finish a todo
 * Delete a Todo

Notes:
 * I went with a simple few file application, I didn't want to overcomplicate such a simple task
 * There is no database backend, it is held in memory. Though I could simply add something I have not at this point
	
Issues I ran into along the way:
 * I found that the most frustrating thing was that these technologies are used so much less than others I am used to. This meant there was a lot less documentation out there, but it also meant I was able to figure things out on my own which is much more satisfying.
