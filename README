# Technical Interview For [siide.com](http://siide.com)
This is basic project running with Backbone.js front end and a Sinatra backend.

## I used

 - [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/)
 - [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)
 
## Requirements

 - Build a single page web app using Sinatra for the backend. 
 - Backbone.js for the front end. 
 - You can use any database backend you'd like. ActiveRecord, Datamapper, Mongoid, straight MongoDB, straight SQL,  SQLite, anything really. At Siide we use Sequel but its not a requirement. You could even store it in memory.
 - Deploy it to Heroku. 
 - Use a public Github account as your repository, you can use a pseudonym if you'd like.
 - Keep track of any issues that got in your way, and roughly how long it took.
 
## Application Requiremenst
 - Create a Todo
 - List todos
 - Finish a todo
 - Delete a Todo

Notes:
